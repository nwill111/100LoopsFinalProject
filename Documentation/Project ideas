Data Set - Esport Subreddit Comments from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/emstatsl/esport-subreddit-comments

Description: A collection of the last 10,000 comments on E-Sport subreddits. Contains the attitude of the comment and the comments themselves.

Potential Customers: Esports Organizations

Problem that is solved: Data can be analyzed to determine public attitude towards different Esport games. This data can be used by ESport organizations to
                        determine what games would be most profitable  to put their focus on and to determine where they should be spending money. If a game's
                        popularity is declining, an ESports organization will be able to see this and pull out of that games ESports scene to save resources.
                        
Product Vision: For ESports Organizations who want to maximize profits and popularity in the ESports industry, the ESport Popularity Analyzer is a website that keeps track of 
                public popularity in various ESport games by analysing social media comments. AI is used to determine the attitude of the comment. From this, comments
                are given a positive/negative rating and compiled in order to determine if the general feelings towards a game is positive or negative. Data will be
                compiled into a clean and easy to understand UI that breaks down what games are trending. Unlike private company owned data analyzers, ESport Popularity
                Analyzer will be available to any organization that would find it useful (even small organizations) instead of being private to one organization. It will be
                useful because it will allow more teams to compete in games that viewers want to see. This will make the viewers happier and will provide more 
                entertainment to them.
